CODING STANDARDS

Coding standards and good practices are essential for software development and scripting, irrespective of the programming languages and coding method followed. The purpose of coding standards is to write clean code, and the key principles of coding standards are:

1. Keep the code simple.
2. Don’t repeat yourself (DRY). This is aimed at avoiding repetition of information.
3. Be consistent when applying coding standards.
4. Comment the code for review and maintenance.

The key benefits of using coding standards are:

1. It helps compliance with industry standards.
2. It maintains code quality.
3. It reduces development costs and accelerates time to market.

CODING COMMENTS

Comments are used to help anyone who is attempting to understand and maintain the actual code. For consistency, comments should adhere to the following guidelines:

- Comments should be included in scripts to provide an explanation of what the code is doing, and to make it easier for the reader to understand and maintain it. For this reason, it is not necessary to try to comment each individual line or to describe obvious code, but it is necessary to comment major blocks of code.
- Comments lines should begin with the ‘ character indented at the same level as the code they are documenting.
- Code comments should be written in clear, concise English with correct spelling and grammar.
- Comments should not be used to teach the reader how to program.
- The purpose of comments is to increase your code readability. Often using good variable and method names makes the code easier to read than if too many comments are present.
- When ‘commenting out’ code, include a description of why you did so. If the code is not necessary, it should be deleted.
- Do not use ‘clutter’ comments, such as an entire line of asterisks. Instead, use a single line space to separate comments from code.
