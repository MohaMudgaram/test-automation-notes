Management thinker Peter Drucker has been quoted saying that ‘What gets measured gets managed’ (Prusak, 2010). This is very relevant for test managers in automation as it is a substantial strategic and tactical investment; hence it needs to be measured correctly. This chapter advises test managers and leaders on how to measure test automation quantitatively on quality terms such as test coverage and metrics.

Metrics are used to measure performance quantitively and provide the key management information for internal and external stakeholders. Software test metrics are used to measure testing activities and track progress and status. KPIs are parameters used to determine the success of business activities. KPIs for test automation are used to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of automated functional testing, automated regression testing and so on. This chapter introduces various metrics and KPIs used for test automation, to be selected based on the organisation’s needs. KPIs and metrics need to be quantitative, reflect the business priorities and be agreed up front with the stakeholders with periodic reviews.

Test automation metrics measure the performance, past, present and future, of the automated testing process to determine if it is delivering an acceptable return on its investment. Implementing automated testing is a process, and any metrics chosen to measure improvement (e.g. the test coverage after implementation of test automation) need to take into account the unique aspects of the organisation, market or environment they are being used in. There is no set of ‘universal metrics’ that will work in every capacity, all the time.

Test automation metrics are used to measure the performance (past, present, future) of the implemented automated testing.

As metrics are used to measure success, it is important that the KPIs and metrics are clearly defined and agree about what success looks like. The effort and outcome should be clearly measurable for automation metrics. Metrics are also used to determine areas for improvement. Test automation metrics reveal the true state of test automation performance, and they help in making the right decision.

Some key benefits of test automation metrics and KPIs are:

- Test automation metrics indicate effectiveness, including effort savings, comparison to manual testing effort, benefits and the ROI. This helps in making decisions on further investment in test automation.
- Requirement coverage metrics show what features are tested and trace them back to the relevant user story or requirement. Requirement coverage and traceability by test automation provides confidence in how well the solution is tested by test automation and assists decision making.
- Code coverage is a measurement of unit test coverage. Code coverage metrics are widely considered as KPIs for unit testing and automated unit testing. Code coverage metrics provide an indication of the stability of the SUT, effectiveness of automated build and deployment validation.
- Test execution metrics include counting the number of tests passed or failed, giving an overview of testing progress and status. This provides end-to-end traceability, more visibility of software quality, prevents escaping defects, exposes quality risks for Sprint planning and helps to improve quality at the organisational level.
- Various defect metrics indicate the effectiveness of testing, quality of the application and defect trends. Defect trends help to improve quality through understanding the behaviour of defects, defect density, common quality issues, defect arrival rates, defect fix trends and so on. Defect metrics also help in achieving cost savings by preventing defects.

The measurement parameters below are used to define various automation test metrics suitable for the organisation. Comparing some of these parameters against manual testing will show how test automation is performing against manual testing. It is essential to understand the organisation’s needs and use combinations of measurement parameters to define the test automation metrics, for example automated versus manual test preparation effort, automated versus manual test execution, or test scripts planned versus executed.

13.1 TEST AUTOMATION METRICS

13.4 MANAGEMENT REPORTING

Test automation metrics and KPIs based on performance data and analysis are key inputs for test leaders and managers to make decisions and advise other senior stakeholders. Metrics are intended to assist the stakeholders in making more accurate, data-driven decisions. It is essential to know how to prepare and present the test metrics to the stakeholders. In this section, a few examples of management-style metrics for stakeholders are presented.

13.4.1 Product automation metrics

Product automation metrics help to understand and measure the level of automation in different products. The metrics measure the level of automation generally achieved in different testing stages or types such as system testing, regression testing, smoke testing or build validation. Figure 13.1 is an example of product automation metrics.

13.4.2 Defect trends

This metric is a key report that provides visibility of the various defect trends, for example defect arrival and defect closure over time. Figure 13.2 is an example of a defect trend metric.

13.4.3 Test automation trend based on coverage and cost

An automated test coverage metric helps to measure and compare the test automation coverage against manual testing or the cost saving. This is a good indication for test automation effort saving. Figure 13.3provides an example of the comparison of test automation with manual testing with respect to cost and coverage.

13.4.4 Test automation trend based on effort and quality

Effort saving is generally a key priority for the IT leadership and metrics related to effort and quality are some of the most valuable sources of information for management. Figure 13.4 is an example comparing test automation with manual testing in respect of effort and quality.

13.4.5 Test automation trend based on test execution rate

Figure 13.5 is an example of the comparison of test automation with manual testing with respect to test execution. This is a key indication for testing achieved by test automation.

13.4.6 Test automation defect removal efficiency

Test automation defect removal efficiency provides a measurement of the removal of defects from the product or release. It is calculated as a ratio of defects found in test automation to total number of defects found across manual and automated testing. Figure 13.6shows an example of test automation defect removal efficiency metrics.

13.4.7 Test automation defect root cause analysis

Root cause analysis is used in software testing to identify the cause of the defects. The metrics related to root cause analysis helps management to identify the key areas for quality improvement. Figure 13.7 is an example of test automation defect root cause analysis.

13.4.8 Test automation defect density

The defect density helps to identify the most problematic area of a product. This will lead to further root cause analysis and helps in understanding the efficiency of testing. Figure 13.8 is an example of test automation defect density metrics.

13.4.9 Test automation environment downtime metrics

The test automation environment downtime-related metrics helps in understanding the impact of test environments on test automation. This helps management in the decision-making process, for example by allocating a dedicated environment for test automation to avoid sharing environment with other teams and avoid interruptions. Figure 13.9 is an example of test automation environment downtime metrics.

13.5 AUTOMATED TEST METRICS

Test automation metrics allow the results of automated testing to be measured, and automated test metrics create metrics automatically without human intervention, for example automated dashboards for metrics.

Test metrics automation is the process through which the reports, metrics and dashboards are created and automatically updated using software. The gathered data, metrics, charts and so on can be delivered to specific email addresses on a regular basis with automatic email dispatches.

Test metrics automation and automated dashboards provide a centralised reporting platform. This helps the dashboard to display KPIs and metrics in one location. Automation reports have multiple benefits, including saving time, viewing robust and up-to-date data from various sources in a single place, enhancing the accuracy of the information and providing more time to analyse the data rather than collecting data. Automating the metrics and reports will save time and energy. Widely used tools like MS Power BI help to automate and personalise reports, metrics and dashboards for the organisation’s needs.

13.6 SUMMARY
