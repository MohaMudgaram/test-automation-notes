Test automation requires a highly skilled team, and understanding how to build a successful automation team is crucial. This chapter is about building and leading a highly successful test automation team.

Building and leading a successful test automation team requires a careful definition of team structure, role descriptions, thorough selection of team members, extensive training, a well-defined career path and development plans.

4.1 TEST AUTOMATION TEAM

The test automation team is expected to have the right mix of programming skills, soft skills, attitude and aptitude. The key factors you should consider in building a test automation team are explained in this section.

4.1.1 Importance of having the right skills

Test automation is often considered as a solution to replace manual testing, manual testers and perform everything with a mouse click. The one reason for this is the sales pitch from automation tool vendors that claim test automation is akin to ‘record and playback’ or ‘scriptless’ automation. The truth is that any sustainable and long-lasting test automation requires a realistic fact-check of the constraints involved in building an optimal test automation team. This follows many of the same disciplines as developing any successful team. However, building an automation team is more difficult than building a software engineering team, as the test automation engineers should have multiple skills, such as coding knowledge, testing skills and good business sense. The automation team consists of experts who know how to develop an automation framework, understand software testing and have good technical skills. If seeking expertise from external sources to build the automation team and framework, the leadership should consider bringing on board a professional testing service company to do this job.

The professional testing services partner will develop the test automation team and framework along with consideration of what is needed in the long run. While a professional testing services company increases the set-up cost, their expertise is invaluable in the important questions they raise up front, including sustainability, in-house test maturity and tooling considerations.

4.1.2 Team and roles

A test manager or Scrum master should be able to build and lead a high performing test automation team that provides a return on investment to the organisation.

The success of any team is heavily dependent on the leadership skills of the team lead; in other words, a team will inherit and follow the leader’s attributes. The team lead is the most important hire you will make when building your test automation team because the leader sets the tone. The team lead should have a good track record of building multiple diverse test automation teams with sound experience in hiring the right resources.

The team certainly needs people with good experience in developing frameworks and good coding skills. Team members should be interested in learning and supporting the development of the automation framework. The latter part of this chapter covers new member selection and interview criteria, their previous experience and their value addition to the team. The interview focus should rely on their previous work, hands-on experience and automation knowledge.

A large public sector application decided to build a test automation team to increase efficiency in their testing. The testing had grown exponentially over the last few years, and the test team doubled its size within a year to manage the additional work. A large amount of testing time was required for data validation and regression testing. The SUT was developed on Microsoft technologies, and most of the solution was hosted in an on-premises environment.

They hired an automation test lead with excellent experience in building a wide variety of automation frameworks, programming skills in an object-oriented language, good team leading skills, tool evaluation skills and manual testing experience. Within a few months, the automation test lead managed to build a team, create a framework and automate data validation testing. The team managed to meet the ROI within six months.

Test automation is a platform of constant change and improvements, and the team members should be open to this. Willingness to learn new technology and tools is essential. The initial members of the team should be a group of specialists such as an SME on the vendor tool, an expert in the specific programming language, a seasoned test automation framework architect and a test manager. The team structure can be defined based on the need for the roles outlined below:

- Automation test manager. This person facilitates and manages team governance. This role is equivalent to a test manager or a Scrum master. The responsibility involves reporting, analysis, test management, tool acquisition, governance and administration, and the skills they bring on board are the ability to have difficult conversations and negotiations, and stakeholder management with a sound automation background.
- Automation test team lead. This person builds the automation framework and should be excellent in mentoring others on how to use and extend the framework. This person must be skilled in test automation, documentation and programming languages.
- Automation architect. This role can be part of the automation test team lead or a separate one, subject to the amount of work to be done and structure of the team. This person is responsible for designing the framework and requires all the attributes of a successful solution architect.
- Test automation engineer. This person supports the lead developer in building the framework. This person should be good at maintaining the framework and automating the SUT using this framework.

4.2 SKILLS

This section explains the important skills required for test automation engineers. There are three ways by which professionals move to test automation:

- Manual testers shift to automation.
- Engineers specialise in test automation.
- Developers shift to automation.

The key prerequisites of a good test automation engineer are covered below.

4.2.1 Generic skills

Generic testing skills (also known as key skills or essential skills) are expected from all the members of the testing team. These skills involve interpersonal as well as testing skills.

Interpersonal skills are the behaviours and tactics a person uses to interact with others, or the ability of a person to work well within the team and with other teams. Interpersonal skills consist of communication, troubleshooting attitude, listening and so on. They are essential for more collaborative teams like DevOps or Agile.

Test certifications such as ISTQB Foundation are a good method to ensure a person has generic testing skills. An understanding and sound knowledge of manual testing concepts and experience is essential for a test automation engineer; after all, it is a testing job! Remember not all testing can be automated, and automated testing is not a replacement for manual testing.

One of the key skills for any tester is to build a good level of knowledge of the SUT, and test automation engineers are not excluded from this. Test automation engineers need to understand the software SUT inside and out.

Test automation engineers should have a good understanding of the following generic testing skills, testing areas and concepts:

- Automation frameworks
- Test architecture
- Test strategy and plan
- Test design
- Non-functional testing
- Configuration management
- Test environments
- Release and deployment
- SDLC types and their characteristics
- Application functional knowledge
- Domain knowledge such as banking, HR, travel or transport
- Business-critical features
- Manual testing processes and techniques
- Technology such as cloud, on-premises, legacy, web or client–server
- Programming languages and packages used in the SUT
- Underlying technologies such as ERP or database
- Automation and market trends
- Converting business requirements to testing requirements
- Interfaces and technologies such as web services and application programming interface (API)
- Quality models such as **Test Maturity Model integration (TMMi)** and **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**
- Risk and issue management
- Project priorities and timeframe
- Good communication and presentation skills

4.2.2 Test automation skills

Expertise in test automation, automated testing and programming are essential for a test automation engineer. These enable them to build high-quality test frameworks and scripts for automated testing. The appropriate assertions, that is coding standards, must be built into the scripts to ensure those automated tests are high quality. Below are some core skills required for test automation engineers:

- Knowledge of test automation tools, such as Selenium, UFT and Eggplant.
- Expertise in different automation frameworks.
- Analytical, problem-solving and logical skills.
- Technical skills, such as:
  - coding
  - scripting
  - object-oriented programming
  - automation architecture
  - automation concepts
  - test data management
  - security standards
  - exception handling
  - reporting and tracking
  - libraries
  - variables
  - test script management
  - programming or scripting languages, such as Python, Pearl, JavaScript, Structured Query Language (SQL) and REST
  - coding standards

4.3 HIRING PROCESS

Testing, as a profession, implies quality and attention to detail. Attracting the right talent and professionals with a testing mindset is half the war won. As a test automation leader, you must ensure the corners are not cut when it comes to selecting the right team. The first step to hiring the right automation resource is to define a job description for the role.

4.3.1 Job description

This section covers what the job description, widely known as JD, is and defines the skills that a test automation engineer should have. A JD describes the roles, skills and responsibilities expected for the position. Automated testing is a highly technically focused role, and central to the role is the hands-on development and execution of automated testing throughout the complete life cycle, from project initiation through to delivery. A JD includes:

- Description of the organisation
- Role description: responsibilities, essential and desirable skills

This section gives a guideline to the skills that are required for a generic automation role. The role is based upon functions performed in the team, and skill is acquired through further training and experience. Roles in the team are relatively constant, and skills develop and change rapidly based on the nature of the automation, application and customers.

4.3.2 Curriculum vitae review

The next important step for hiring a test automation engineer is the CV review. The following section covers a few questions to be considered in a CV review:

- What is the candidate’s experience in automation, automation framework and programming languages?
- Have they included a broad range of relevant experience?
- Have they used examples to demonstrate these skills?
- Do they follow trends in test automation? Do their projects follow the tool journey, such as a different version of the tool? For example WinRunner to QuickTest Professional (QTP) to UFT, or the 30-year tool journey from Microsoft Windows 1 (year 1985) to Windows 10 (year 2015).
- Do they have a LinkedIn account? Check the information on the account and whether it is in line with their work and networks.

4.3.3 The interview

The interview structure is heavily dependent on the company and its culture. Most companies carry out an initial screening by the human resource team to check for company and role fit, followed by a short telephone technical interview. Many companies have moved the interview process to virtual platforms. A video interview is now considered as close to an in-person meeting in understanding the candidate and their responses.

This section covers a standard interview structure. The first stage is an initial technical screening.

Interview 1: initial screening (approximately 30 minutes):

1. Introduction
2. Testing and automation capability interview based on CV
3. Summary of the interview and the next steps

The second stage is a detailed technical screening based on a test automation-related case study.

Interview 2: technical assessment (approximately 120 minutes):

1. Introduction
2. Case study based on the approach to automate or create an automation framework, for example an application such as a credit card form or social media account
3. Candidate presentation of the case study
4. Interview based on the case study
5. Technical interview based on CV
6. Question and answer (Q&A)
7. Closing and next steps

The presentation relates to the candidate’s understanding of automation, framework development and test life cycles. The presentation will be based on the case study, and will greatly depend on the candidate’s relevant business, tools, automation, industry, companies, products, location and technology experience. The other aspects that may be verified in the interview are shown in the below table.

In most companies, this interview is performed by a senior person, such as a group head or a head of a product line, along with the human resources team to check for the match of the role and the company.

Interview and final assessment (approximately 30 minutes):

1. Introduction
2. Generic interview
