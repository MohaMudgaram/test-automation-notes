| Project description | As part of a smart implementation programme, a number of strategic IT developments were delivered as a set of tactical solutions to support the programme. With the addition of new services and migration of data from legacy applications, it became apparent that some elements of the system architecture implemented under the original phase of the project needed to be refined to aid in the stability of the suite of applications and provide a base for the introduction of additional functionality and data volumes. The delivery was grouped into 10 releases comprising 23 major change requests and 24 major defect fixes. |

| Team                | The test team comprised five test analysts, two senior testers and a test manager/Scrum master.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Testing             | As the third-party vendor performed limited system and integration testing, it was decided that the system integrator and client test team would conduct extensive system acceptance testing, system integration testing, field pilot testing and user acceptance testing to evaluate the risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
