The people who build automated testing are widely known as test automation SMEs, automation testers, technical testers or test automation engineers. This book uses ‘test automation engineer’ to ensure consistency. This chapter provides insight on how to build and lead a successful career in test automation and the skills required in order to enhance career progress, as well as lateral career movement from coding or manual testing to automated testing. The focus also remains on the competency matrix for a test automation engineer.

A subject matter expert has a sound knowledge of and expertise in a specific area, and they are considered an authority in this area. A test automation SME is an expert in test automation, the process and technology.

9.1 ESSENTIAL SKILLS FOR A TEST AUTOMATION ENGINEER

The test automation engineer prepares, performs and reports on the specialist testing of products and services by utilising an appropriate tool or technical skill in close liaison with the project team. An experienced test automation engineer in their field is capable of managing, designing, developing, executing and reporting on automated testing utilising the tools or scripting skills.

Test automation engineer is the ‘person who is responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of a test automation architecture as well as the technical evolution of the resulting test automation solution’ according to ISTQB Glossary.

Developing code and script is a developer’s work in any software solution, and manual testers validate the developer’s work based on the requirements. However, a test automation engineer performs both a developer’s job and a manual tester’s job by validating the requirements manually and using an automated script developed for testing. Writing code and debugging is part of a test automation engineer’s job, and they require software programming or coding knowledge to perform this well.

Test automation engineers are often asked to do manual testing. However, ‘one size fits all’ is not a good approach as both require different skills. Manual testers may not have the right test automation skill, and test automation engineers often get bored doing manual testing in the long term. The list below and the below figure present the essential skills required for a test automation engineer:

- Testing skills
- Requirements knowledge
- Manual testing
- IT skills
- Knowledge of the SUT
- Problem-solving skills
- Expertise in test automation tools
- Knowledge of software development processes and approaches
- Documentation skills
- Knowledge of the latest test automation trends
- Reporting skills
- Decision-making ability

The following sections describe the essential skills required for a test automation engineer in detail.

9.1.1 Testing skills

A tester verifies the quality of a test object through the preparation and execution of appropriate tests. A test object can vary from a feature, function or interface between two applications, to a total end-to-end solution. The test object can be functional features or non-functional aspects such as backup, restoration, performance, accessibility or compatibility. In addition to testing skills, a test automation engineer is expected to have good programming or coding skills.

- Apply Agile techniques such as leading in daily stand-ups and scrums, and use of backlogs.
- Hold the ISTQB Advanced Test Automation Engineer or ISTQB Advanced Technical Test Analyst and tool-specific certifications.

9.1.2 Business domain and requirement knowledge

Business domain and requirements are classified as either functional or non-functional requirements, and it is essential that a good test automation engineer understands them and can assess their impact on testing and test automation. Functional testing verifies application behaviour, and non-functional testing verifies the sustainability of the system, such as performance, security and scalability. Engineers also require domain knowledge (such as in informatics, retail or banking) to design effective TASs.

A scientific software product company is a leading market player in delivering products and solutions for research (simulation) and education. Their products have been developed over two decades of research and development. These products were mostly developed by university students for research purposes and were enhanced further into fully operational products. Testing these products was very challenging as there were no definite outcomes and required deep domain knowledge. The expected results varied from time to time. Most of the testing was performed manually by scientists or subject matter experts along with core testing professionals. Testing was time-consuming and heavily dependent on domain knowledge.

As part of test automation, the scientists and SMEs received training on the testing tools. Their in-depth knowledge of functional requirements and scientific domains helped them to automate the testing. The test organisation managed to automate all manual testing using the software and skills of the SMEs.

An experienced test automation engineer understands requirements and their impact on automated testing. This helps them to prioritise and automate critical business features. Knowledge of business requirements helps the test automation engineer to:

- Identify business-critical scenarios for test automation.
- Comprehend how the solution works to develop effective automated tests.
- Identify the right test automation framework.
- Understand business priorities.
- Design scalable automation suites.

9.1.3 Manual testing skills

Manual testing is the prerequisite and essential skill for any testing – functional, non-functional or automation. The test automation engineer has a thorough knowledge of manual testing to create effective automated testing solutions. Manual testing helps them to understand the domain and features better. Many teams prefer test automation engineers to test the solution manually before creating automated testing. The manual testing process and steps assist the test automation engineers to understand how the solution works.

Manual testing skills are key factors in the decision-making process for what needs to be automated. Manual testing skills support test automation in the following activities:

- Identifying candidates for manual and automated testing
- Identifying scenarios for regression testing
- Choosing candidates for high ROI
- Separating the time-consuming tests such as data-driven or multi-browser
- Better understanding of manual and automated testing
- Manual intervention to interpret automated test results

9.1.4 Technical skills

The de facto skills for automated testing are technical and coding knowledge, both of which are difficult to learn and excel at. A tester with good manual and technical skills succeeds in automation, as this is one of the primary reasons why many manual testers with expertise in coding make a lateral career move to automated testing. A good starting point in automated testing is being involved in maintaining and enhancing the existing automated test suite. This builds expertise in how scripts work and enhances them to be more effective. The key IT skills required for automated testing are:

- Proficiency in programming languages such as Java, .NET, Python, Perl, C/C++, SQL, XML and HTML
- SQL to retrieve specific information from databases
- Good coding skill
- Good understanding of automated test scripts
- Expertise in test automation frameworks
- Detailed knowledge of automation tools
- Debugging skills
- Knowledge of platforms such as on-premises, cloud and hybrid
- Experience in test environments such as development, test and production
- Knowledge of IT infrastructure
- Experience in tool installation and configuration
- Ability to read and understand SUT architecture
- Experience in automation framework architecture
- Expertise in PoT and PoC

A government organisation spent billions annually in meeting its communication objectives, the bulk of which was in print communication. This leading and reputed organisation analysed spending behaviour and ROI and decided to use IT to reduce costs. One major outcome was the idea to develop a portal, attract the public and reduce the print media. Testing was a core activity for the IT solution to ensure the solution met expected results accurately. Test automation was heavily used to reduce the cost of testing in the long run.

IT knowledge is a key skill for successful automated testing. The automation team used their prior experience in development and coding to support both the development and testing teams. As part of defect reporting, the automation team managed to provide root-cause analysis to the development team. Technical skills helped the automation team create a competent automation framework.

9.1.5 Knowledge of system under test

Test automation engineers need to acquire good knowledge of SUT, application behaviour, technology, architecture and business requirements to develop effective automation solutions. The following areas of the SUT are particularly relevant:

- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Programming languages used to develop the SUT
- SUT architecture
- Interfaces, web services and APIs used
- Functions and features of the application
- Database
- Current testing process of the SUT
- Release environments
- Complexity of the application
- Domain and sector
- Regulations such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
- Compliance, such as for browsers, operating systems, mobile and web

These areas can influence and impact the design, development and execution of the test automation suite.

9.1.6 Problem-solving and decision-making ability

Problem solving is a key skill for software coding and is essential for any test automation engineer. Problem solving involves:

- Problem definition
- Investigating the cause of the problem
- Identifying solutions
- Prioritising solutions
- Selecting a solution
- Implementing the selected solution

It requires:

- Active listening and analysis
- Research and investigation
- Creativity
- A positive attitude and aptitude
- Communication

Decision making is an important part of coding, test management and system design. This is an essential skill expected from all levels of test automation professionals. Decision making is performed algorithmically or heuristically. An algorithm is a precise set of rules and conditions that never change, while a heuristic is a set of rules that may change over time as conditions change. It is easy to think of automating tasks traditionally performed by people, but wrong decision making placed into a machine can become a critical quality issue of the system.

Problem-solving skills enable handling of unexpected situations or difficult challenges. Problem solving is a key check involved in the hiring process of test automation engineers; at junior levels, the focus is on aptitude and technical abilities, and at senior levels it is about decision making. A few hiring questions related to problem solving and decision making are shown below.

Junior levels:

- What is the 5-digit maximum prime number? How did you arrive at the answer?
- What is the minimum number of satellites required to cover the whole earth, and why? Explain your rationale.

Senior levels:

- Give an example of when you ran into a problem on a project and how you solved it.
- How would you manage a dissatisfied manager, stakeholder or customer?

Test automation engineers need good problem-solving and decision-making ability and technical knowledge to be successful. In the automation test design phases, test automation engineers come across scenarios to create scripts that cover many possible outcomes, including positive, alternate and error handling scenarios. Good problem-solving skills are an advantage in developing better and more effective automation test scripts to handle real-time scenarios.

9.1.7 Knowledge of test automation tools

Test automation engineers are expected to be proficient in the use of automation tools and underlying programming languages. In practice, most projects and organisations choose widely available tools and frameworks in the industry, and test automation engineers are expected to be familiar with them.

Most job descriptions clearly demand expertise in these testing tools as they have active community support and provide immediate results. The bespoke (customised based on client requirements) test automation tools and frameworks provide numerous benefits and advantages. Expertise in these tools reduces automation effort and improves the ability to conduct a PoC. Prior knowledge of the automation tools avoids a PoC for known platforms and provides immediate returns.

In the current environment, companies and stakeholders expect quick ROI and speedy and high-quality deliverables, and expertise in automation tools is an added advantage to meeting these stakeholder expectations. Being a skilled test automation engineer with in-depth technical knowledge and experience in leading/popular automated testing tools is mandatory. test automation engineers are also required to advise on the tool setup and infrastructure requirements such as hardware, licensing, installation and configuration.

9.1.8 Knowledge of software development process and approaches

The flavours of Waterfall and Agile are widely used in the industry, and test automation engineers should demonstrate good knowledge of software development approaches like these. The project and the organisation expect the automation team to be well versed in popular development approaches and deliver in line with them.

Waterfall, DevOps and Agile work differently and a lack of experience in these processes will impact the ability to deliver automated testing. Good knowledge of the development process enhances a test automation engineer’s career, and certifications such as Certified Scrum Master or Certified Product Owner provide an additional advantage.

Test automation engineers are also expected to have expertise in the different phases of testing such as test planning, design, execution, defect management and reporting. Automated testing follows a similar life cycle to software development: planning, design, execution, maintenance and closure.

9.1.9 Documentation, communication and reporting skill

Documentation and reporting are two key skills for any test automation engineer. Automation test strategy, plan and approach are the essential documents involved in automated testing. Good documentation communicates a clear message to the stakeholders. Automation funding and approval are often subject to good, clear documentation, and poor documents impact the decision-making process.

Another key document is test reporting, most of which can be automated. Automated test execution reports are easy to manage as they are scheduled to be created and circulated automatically without any human intervention.

Documentation is largely ignored by many development and testing projects. However, well-documented automated tests add value in the decision making for PoC, maintenance and bug fixes. Test automation engineers are the developers of test scripts, and their code must be documented and commented in peer reviews to support team collaboration.

Good communication and collaboration are essential skills for a test automation engineer. This is important for team bonding among test automation engineers and other team members. Test reports with effective communication are vital in establishing trust with stakeholders.

9.1.10 Knowledge of the latest trends in test automation

Automated testing is continually evolving, from the ‘record and playback’ to advanced automated suites, simple tools to highly sophisticated frameworks, and manual testing to codeless scripting. The vendors look beyond the current market and release automation tools for future needs. A good and successful test automation engineer stays ahead of the trends and updates themselves in order to be on top of the latest developments. The best practices, standards, guidelines, automated testing frameworks, tools and script development processes are constantly evolving. Test automation is moving swiftly to AI, ML and robotics, and it is important to be aware of the latest trends, tools, products and so on. The latest trends provide the opportunity to understand the evolving challenges and act accordingly.

Technology changes rapidly and is challenging to keep up with. Professional bodies such as Agile Alliance, Association of Computer Engineers and Technicians, and BCS organise events to create awareness and discussion on emerging trends. In addition, books, points of view and articles from reputed practitioners are good sources of information. Well-known publications and online websites such as LinkedIn publish the latest trends on a regular basis. Tech communities are a good source of the latest trends along with IT conferences. Tool vendors actively reach out to the automation test practitioners to evaluate new tools, giving them a wonderful opportunity to experience the upcoming tool features hands-on.

Functional testing tools over the last two decades have evolved, for example WinRunner as the predominant tool to QTP and thereafter Selenium WebDriver, which is in high demand of late.

9.2 BUILDING A SUCCESSFUL CAREER IN TEST AUTOMATION
